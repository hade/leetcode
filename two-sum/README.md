# Two Sum

## Solutions
Don't know what to think of this. First-run was using reduce and slicing. Not very efficient, but quite easy to follow. Was not very efficient, being only around 15% better than the rest submissions. 

Next improved version was based on a simple for-loop. It used indexOf with the starting index defined for a better results. Got around 80%. Was happy about it. 

I also copied the winner solution as winner.js. Brilliant. It's using just an object to store the first value's difference.
