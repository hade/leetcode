# 04 Median of Two Sorted Arrays

```
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
```

This last part makes this hard. Basically if 10 items will take x amount of time, for 100 items it should only take 2x, not 10x.
