# Add Two Numbers
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

## Idea
The idea here is to handle two linked lists, sum nodes together and retun answer as a linked list as well. Got 61 % better than average as a first go. Gonna live it there. I was approaching this problem a bit differently than others. Was using recursive function and 10 exponents to get this one solved. 

The first submission failed because normal integers were not big enough. Javascript started showing integers in a scientific format and cutting the accuracy.
